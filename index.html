        <p>
            Eco Club is a student led club that seeks to make the school more eco-friendly, raise awareness on simple ways every individual can help, and fundraise in order to donate to non-profit organizations that are helping the environment. 
            We plan on organizing high school events where we can raise money for a variety of environmental issues, such as helping endangered animals or volunteering to do plastic cleanups, and advocate against food waste. 
            Through these events we want to motivate and inspire more students to act, educate themselves, and become aware. This is a topic we feel very strongly about and would like to extend participation and involvement to the whole community! 
            If you are passionate about the environment and want to make a difference, this is the club for you!
